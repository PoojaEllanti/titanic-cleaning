# Titanic Dataset Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess raw data for machine learning using the Titanic dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `notebook/`: Contains the exploratory Jupyter Notebook.
- `src/`: Script for reusable data cleaning.
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.

## ðŸ§¹ Cleaning Steps

1. Loaded Titanic dataset.
2. Handled missing values (Age and Embarked).
3. Encoded categorical columns (Sex and Embarked).
